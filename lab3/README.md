### Task: Take code of randomly choosen person and write 10 unit tests

### What I have learned / done thanks to this labs:
- writing unit tests in python with setup and teardown methods
- working with someone else's code (using it, understanding it etc.)
- realized how important it is to write clean, simple and understandable code so that other programmers could easy get into detail
- learned how small, single-tasked functions/methods help in writing unit testes and understanding the program logic
